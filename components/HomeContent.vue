        Hi, My Name is Julia Sternkopf. <br />
        I am enviromental/portrait painter that is based within central otago. I
        am from Germany spenting most of my childhood drawing, painting and
        being creative in whatever way possible. In late 2018 I moved to Wanaka,
        New Zealand. Being surrounded by the most amazing scenery I had ever
        seen and my passion for landscape painting was sparked. Whenever I can,
        I try to get out there, go hiking and exploring New Zealand's beautiful
        and pristine wilderness, taking the inspiration back to the studio to
        try and recreate the feeling of being out there again.
